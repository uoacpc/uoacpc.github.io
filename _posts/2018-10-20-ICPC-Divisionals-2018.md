ICPC divisional finals has officially ended! This year we had 4 teams from UofA, all of which put in great effort.

- The first position was bagged by Stinkypete (Yuanjing Zhao, Hoang Vinh Dinh, Christo Pyromallis) - they solved 11/12 problems and got themselves an overall rank of 6 i.e. they are going to regionals for sure (although official notices have yet to come)

- The second position was bagged by TensorMellow (Miguel Martin, Farbod Motlagh, Ragav Sachdeva) - they solved 10/12 problems and got themselves an overall rank of 14 (it's likely they won't make it to regionals due to their high time penalty though).

- The third position was bagged by 3SpacesPerTab (Brandon Smart, Chris Shi) - they solved 8/12 problems and got themselves an overall rank of 26. Note: that it was a team of 2 only and both being FIRST year students.

These are great results and we look forward to the results of regionals!!
